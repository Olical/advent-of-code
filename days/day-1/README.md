# Day 1

We had to take an input of various opening and closing parentheses and answer two questions about them.

 * To what floor do the instructions take Santa?
 * What is the position of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement?

> An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.
